# ec2-spot-converter

This tool converts existing AWS EC2 instances back and forth between On-Demand and 'persistent' Spot billing models while preserving
instance attributes (Launch configuration, Tags..), network attributes (existing Private IP addresses, Elastic IP), storage (Volumes),
Elastic Inference accelerators, ELB Target Groups instance registrations and Elastic GPUs.

Others features:
* Can also perform **Spot-to-Spot** and **OnDemand-to-OnDemand** conversions:
	* Allow replacement of existing Spot instances with new "identical" ones to update the instance type and CPU options,
	* Help to fix some Spot instance conditions (Ex: *'IncorrectSpotRequestState Exception'*),
	* Allow Root Disk encryption during conversion.

Conversion time ranges from 2 to 5 minutes depending on the instance type.

> **IMPORTANT REMARK**: This tool aims to ease handling of **'Pet'** machines when you have to do so (very frequent after a pure *Lift&Shift*
migration into the Cloud). The author strongly advises to always consider managing resources as **'Cattle'** (with IaC, AutoScaling Groups, Stateless...).
**As a consequence, this tool should be only useful transient while transitionning to [Cloud Native best-practices](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/fundamentals-core-concepts/#Performance_Efficiency)**.

# Getting started

**Prerequisistes:**
* Install the tool on an EC2 Linux instance located **in the same account and region than the instance to convert**,

```shell
TOOL_VERSION=`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcjorel/ec2-spot-converter/master/VERSION.txt`
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcjorel/ec2-spot-converter/master/releases/ec2-spot-converter-${TOOL_VERSION} -o ec2-spot-converter
chmod u+x ec2-spot-converter
```

* Attach to the EC2 tool instance an IAM role with provided [policy.json](policy.json) file,
* Install Python3 and **boto3** package (with `python3 -m pip install boto3`).

```
If the option `--review-conversion-result` is specified, at conversion end, a **VIm Diff** window pops-up and allow interactive review of the differences between
the original now terminated instance and the newly created one: You should see differences only related to dates, Association Ids, AMI Id (and all volume Ids with 'DeleteOnTermination=True' like the Root volume).

### Convert a Spot instance to On-Demand model

The operation is similar to the Spot model conversion with the difference that the option `--target-billing-model` must be set to `on-demand` explicitly.

> Note: `ec2-spot-converter` can also convert back an instance currently in **Spot interrupted** state to On-Demand model.

### Convert a Spot instance to Spot model to change the instance type and/or CPU Options

`ec2-spot-converter`tool can be used to replace a Spot instance by another one just changing the instance type. This operation is not 
yet possible "in-place" through an AWS EC2 API so the tool will terminate and replace the Spot instance preserving all attributes but
updating the instance type (or CPU options) during the process.

Specify options `--target-instance-type` and/or `--cpu-options`on an existing Spot instance to start conversion. 

### Fix Spot instance with 'IncorrectSpotRequestState Exception'

The tool is able to fix '*IncorrectSpotRequestState Exceptions*' due to the Spot request been cancelled by the user but the Spot instance was
left running. This kind of instance may suffer some unexpected behaviors like no possibility to stop them anymore.

The tool can be used to recreate a new healthy Spot instance from the problematic Spot instance.

Simply call `ec2-spot-converter` with the problematic Instance Id and specify options --target-billing-model 'spot'
**and --do-not-require-stopped-instance** (as the instance can not be stopped).

> It is recommended to perform a System stop (so **NOT a System reboot**) on the guest Operating System to switch Read-Only
all volumes and ensure Filesystem data consistency. On a Linux guest, usually, the Linux command `halt` will stop the Operating
System safely and won't reboot immediatly: Please ensure that the message `"reboot: System halted."` is displayed on the guest
console thanks to AWS Console screenshot feature. 

### Encrypt Root Disk during conversion

The tool can be used to encrypt the Root Disk (and more generally, all volumes marked with attribute *DeleteOnTermination=True* that will be part of the 
Backup AMI).

Simply specify option `--volume-kms-key-id` with a valid KMS Key Id and all volumes part of the Backup AMI will be encrypted in the new instance. 
If a volume is already encrypted, it will be left as-is just generating a warning.

Ex:

	--volume-kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:111111111111:key/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666666666666

If you want to convert **Spot-to-Spot** or **OnDemand-to-OnDemand**, specify `--force` option as well.

                        CPUOptions structure in the new EC2 Launch
                        specification.

                        the EBS volume(s). Note: You cannot specify 'aws/ebs'
                        directly, please specify the plain KMS Key ARN
                        instead. It applies ONLY to volumes placed in the

                        the instnace.
  --wait-for-elb-health
                        Wait for ELB target registration to be healthy at end
                        of conversion.
  --do-not-require-stopped-instance
                        Allow instance conversion while instance is in

                        'VIM' EDITOR!
  --dynamodb-tablename DYNAMODB_TABLENAME
                        A DynamoDB table name to hold conversion states.
                        Default: 'ec2-spot-converter-state-table'
  --generate-dynamodb-table
                        Create a DynamoDB table to hold conversion states.

                        (DANGEROUS) Force the state machine to go back to the
                        specified processing step.
  -d, --debug           Turn on debug traces.
  -v, --version         Display tool version.

```

> At the end of a conversion, the tool can replay as many times as wished former conversion results specifying the original instance id: It will display again all execution steps and it can be useful to review again the conversion result (VIm Diff window) of a previous run. The `--delete-ami` option can also be added in a subsequent call to suppress the AMI and associated snapshots built by a previous tool execution.


## Resilience 

The tool is designed with maximum safety of stateful data and operations in mind: All conversion states are persisted in a DynamoDB table and, if the tool is interrupted or
encounters an error, it should be restartable where it went interrupted without special user action. In the unexpected (and unlikely) event of a major bug and bad outcome, 
please consult the DynamoDB line corresponding to your instance Id: This line contains JSON states of your original instance and other information (AMI, Interfaces...)
allowing to reconstruct the original instance by hand. **In such event, please also create a GitHub issue with a precise description of the encountered problem and so help improving the tool!**
